title: Pre San Diego Hacks!
---
Less then one week until San Diego Hacks. "What is San Diego Hacks?" you might ask. [SDHacks](http://www.sdhacks.io) is a hackathon taking place at UC San Diego October 2-4. There will be teams from schools all over California to compete for prizes. Teams have the freedom to choose what they want to build anything from web and mobile applications to lower level hardware programming.

My team will be working on a mobile android application which will integrate the Facebook chat. I will be focusing on the backend of the application in Node. My buddy Nick Roberts will be building out the frontend in Java and android. We will probably pick up another team member or two to help out.

I am really looking forward to this networking opportunity. Getting to meet like minded people from all over the state, and participate in a competition is valuable. There are a number of big companies sponsoring the event like Qualcomm, Facebook, and Google. I'm looking forward to seeing what smaller companies from the San Diego area will be hanging around.

Stay tuned for the after SDHacks post!
